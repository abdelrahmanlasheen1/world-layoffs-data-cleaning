-- For the data cleaning process, I followed these main steps:
-- 1. Checked for duplicates and removed them where necessary.
-- 2. Standardized the data and fixed errors.
-- 3. Reviewed and handled null values.
-- 4. Removed unnecessary columns and rows.


-- 1. Remove Duplicates
-- First, I checked the dataset for duplicate records.

-- 2. Standardize Data

SELECT * 
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;

-- While reviewing the 'industry' column, I noticed some null and empty values, so I investigated these rows further.
SELECT DISTINCT industry
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
ORDER BY industry;

SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE industry IS NULL 
OR industry = ''
ORDER BY industry;

-- let's take a look at these
SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE company LIKE 'Bally%';
-- looks fine 
SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE company LIKE 'airbnb%';

-- I noticed that 'Airbnb' should be classified as 'Travel', but the value is missing in some rows.  
-- I applied a query to update null industry values based on other rows with the same company name.  
-- This approach scales well for large datasets, avoiding manual checks for each row.

-- I converted blank values to NULLs, as this makes them easier to handle during analysis.

UPDATE world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
SET industry = NULL
WHERE industry = '';

-- After the update, I verified that all previously blank values are now set to NULL.

SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE industry IS NULL 
OR industry = ''
ORDER BY industry;

-- Next, I populated the NULL values where possible using existing non null values from other rows of the same company.

UPDATE layoffs_staging2 t1
JOIN layoffs_staging2 t2
ON t1.company = t2.company
SET t1.industry = t2.industry
WHERE t1.industry IS NULL
AND t2.industry IS NOT NULL;

-- After the update, I found that Bally's was the only company without another row to fill its NULL values.
SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE industry IS NULL 
OR industry = ''
ORDER BY industry;

-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- I noticed that the 'industry' column contains multiple variations of "Crypto".  
-- I standardized all of them to a single value: 'Crypto'.
SELECT DISTINCT industry
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
ORDER BY industry;

UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET industry = 'Crypto'
WHERE industry IN ('Crypto Currency', 'CryptoCurrency');

-- now that's done. 

SELECT DISTINCT industry
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
ORDER BY industry;

-- --------------------------------------------------

SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;

-- Everything looks consistent except for the 'country' column, where some entries have a trailing period like "United States"
-- I standardized these values by removing the trailing period.

SELECT DISTINCT country
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
ORDER BY country;

UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET country = TRIM(TRAILING '.' FROM country);

-- After applying the update, I verified that all country entries are now consistent.
SELECT DISTINCT country
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
ORDER BY country;


-- I also cleaned and standardized the 'date' column to ensure consistent date formatting.
SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;

-- I used STR_TO_DATE to convert the text values in the 'date' column into proper DATE format.
UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET `date` = STR_TO_DATE(`date`, '%m/%d/%Y');

-- After converting the text values, I updated the column's data type to DATE for proper handling.
ALTER TABLE layoffs_staging2
MODIFY COLUMN `date` DATE;


SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;





-- 3. Review Null Values
-- I examined the null values in 'total_laid_off', 'percentage_laid_off', and 'funds_raised_millions'.  
-- I decided to leave them as NULLs since this makes calculations easier during the EDA phase.  
-- No changes were needed for these columns.

-- 4. Remove Unnecessary Columns and Rows
-- I identified and removed columns and rows that were not useful for analysis.
SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE total_laid_off IS NULL;


SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE total_laid_off IS NULL
AND percentage_laid_off IS NULL;

-- I deleted rows that contained unusable or irrelevant data to clean the dataset further.
DELETE FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE total_laid_off IS NULL
AND percentage_laid_off IS NULL;

SELECT * 
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;

ALTER TABLE layoffs_staging2
DROP COLUMN row_num;
